# Habit Tracker – Mobile-Based Personalized Cognitive Enhancement System

This project is a research-backed mobile application designed to enhance cognitive function by analyzing and optimizing daily activities. It tracks habits, visualizes patterns, and provides personalized recommendations to support brain health and memory performance.

## 📱 About the Project
The Habit Tracker app is built for individuals looking to maintain or improve their cognitive performance through lifestyle choices. It focuses on:

- Monitoring daily habits (physical activity, sleep, hobbies)
- Visualizing activity data over time
- Providing personalized recommendations based on machine learning
- Supporting long-term cognitive well-being

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Habit Tracking** – Log physical, cognitive, and leisure activities
- **Data Visualization** – Interactive charts and progress bars
- **Weekly Insights** – Behavior reports tied to memory goals
- **ML-Powered Recommendations** – Tailored advice using Random Forest

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **ML Model:** Python (Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree)
- **APIs:** Postman for testing
- **Tools:** Figma (UI/UX), Jupyter Notebook (model training)

## 📊 ML Model Accuracy
The system achieved an **83% accuracy** in predicting memory-impacting behaviors using a Random Forest classifier.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/client` – React Native mobile application
- `/server` – Node.js backend with API endpoints
- `/model` – Python-based ML training and evaluation
- `/docs` – Research documentation and architecture diagrams

## 🧪 Testing
